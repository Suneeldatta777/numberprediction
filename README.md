This Python script demonstrates the process of building and training a simple neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The script begins by loading and normalizing the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images. It then visualizes the first image in the training set. A neural network model is constructed using a sequential architecture with a flattening layer, a dense hidden layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation, and a final dense layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation for output classification. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss, then trained over 10 epochs. Finally, the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated on the test dataset, and the accuracy is displayed. This example provides a basic introduction to image classification using deep learning.
